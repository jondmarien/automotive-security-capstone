You are a senior mobile application developer with expertise in Flutter and IoT device connectivity. Help me develop a cross-platform mobile application for my automotive security system that monitors suspicious RF signals in vehicles.

My project specifications:
- Flutter-based mobile app (iOS and Android)
- Connects to a custom hardware dongle via BLE or Wi-Fi
- Displays real-time alerts when suspicious RF signals are detected
- Shows historical data and signal strength information
- User configuration for sensitivity and alert preferences
- Clean, modern UI based on provided mockups

Using the mockups I've provided, please create a detailed implementation plan with the following elements:

1. **App Architecture:**
   - State management solution (Provider, BLoC, or Redux)
   - Folder structure for a maintainable codebase
   - Dependency injection approach
   - Navigation strategy (Navigator 2.0 or Go Router)
   - Data persistence strategy (Hive, SQLite, or Shared Preferences)

2. **UI Implementation:**
   - Detailed component breakdown for the dashboard screen showing signal strength
   - Implementation of the alert screens with visual indicators
   - Settings screen with adjustable thresholds
   - History view with filtering capabilities
   - Custom widgets for signal visualization
   - Dark/light theme support
   - Accessibility considerations

3. **BLE/Wi-Fi Communication:**
   - Service discovery and connection management
   - Protocol for device pairing and authentication
   - Data serialization format (JSON) for RF signal information
   - Background service implementation for continuous monitoring
   - Connection recovery strategies
   - Battery optimization techniques

4. **Real-time Alerts:**
   - Push notification implementation
   - In-app alert display with priority levels
   - Sound and vibration feedback options
   - Actionable notifications with quick response options
   - Background detection when app is closed

5. **Security Features:**
   - Data encryption for stored information
   - Secure communication with the dongle
   - User authentication (if required)
   - Privacy considerations for location data
   - Secure storage of settings

6. **Testing Strategy:**
   - Unit tests for core business logic
   - Widget tests for UI components
   - Integration tests for BLE/Wi-Fi communication
   - Simulated device testing approach
   - Performance profiling on different devices

Please provide code examples for critical components, detailed explanation of the BLE communication protocol, state management implementation, and UI rendering approach. Include error handling strategies and user experience considerations specific to automotive security applications.
