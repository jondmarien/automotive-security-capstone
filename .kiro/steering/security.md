# Security Architecture & Threat Modeling

## Security-First Design Philosophy

This automotive security capstone project implements a comprehensive security-by-design approach, addressing both the security threats it detects and the security of the monitoring system itself.

## Automotive Security Threat Landscape

### Threat Classification System

#### Threat Levels (Enum-based Classification)

```python
class ThreatLevel(Enum):
    BENIGN = auto()      # Normal automotive RF activity
    SUSPICIOUS = auto()  # Unusual patterns requiring investigation
    MALICIOUS = auto()   # Clear attack signatures detected
    CRITICAL = auto()    # Confirmed multi-modal attack with high confidence
```

#### Threat Scoring Algorithm

- **Signal Analysis**: Frequency, power, modulation characteristics
- **Pattern Recognition**: Known attack signatures and anomalies
- **Context Awareness**: Time of day, location, vehicle state
- **Historical Correlation**: Comparison with baseline behavior
- **Multi-Modal Correlation**: RF-NFC coordinated attack detection
- **Temporal Analysis**: Multi-window analysis for brute force attack patterns
- **Confidence Scoring**: Probability assessment of threat classification with evidence collection

#### Escalation Thresholds

- **BENIGN → SUSPICIOUS**: Unusual but explainable activity
- **SUSPICIOUS → MALICIOUS**: Clear attack patterns or multiple indicators
- **Alert Triggers**: Immediate notification for MALICIOUS threats
- **Logging Requirements**: All SUSPICIOUS and MALICIOUS events logged
