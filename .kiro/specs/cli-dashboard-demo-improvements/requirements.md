# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical user experience issues in the CLI dashboard that are impacting demo quality and usability. The automotive security monitoring system is 95% complete, but several bugs and UX issues need to be resolved to ensure smooth demonstrations and professional presentation quality. These improvements focus on fixing display bugs, improving user interactions, and enhancing the overall demo experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix Synthetic Signal Generation

**User Story:** As a developer demonstrating the system, I want the `--synthetic` flag to work without errors, so that I can showcase all attack types during presentations without requiring physical hardware.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user runs `python cli_dashboard.py --mock --synthetic` THEN the system SHALL start without throwing ScenarioType attribute errors
2. WHEN synthetic signals are generated THEN the system SHALL support all attack types including SIGNAL_CLONING_ATTACK, and any other missing attack
3. WHEN synthetic mode is active THEN all attack scenarios SHALL be available for demonstration
4. WHEN synthetic signals are processed THEN they SHALL display properly in the dashboard with realistic data

### Requirement 2: Eliminate Data Duplication in Display Panels

**User Story:** As a user viewing the dashboard, I want clean, non-duplicated information in the Signal Analysis and Technical Evidence panels, so that I can easily read and understand the threat details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN threat events are displayed THEN the Signal Analysis panel SHALL show unique, non-duplicated information
2. WHEN technical evidence is presented THEN each piece of evidence SHALL appear only once per event
3. WHEN switching between events THEN the panels SHALL update cleanly without showing stale or duplicate data
4. WHEN the dashboard refreshes THEN all displayed information SHALL remain consistent and non-duplicated

### Requirement 3: Fix Critical Alert Display Refresh Bug

**User Story:** As a user monitoring critical threats, I want the dashboard to remain stable and readable during critical alerts, so that I can analyze the threat details without visual interference.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a CRITICAL threat is detected THEN the dashboard SHALL NOT continuously refresh or flicker
2. WHEN viewing a historical CRITICAL event THEN the display SHALL remain stable and readable
3. WHEN navigating through events containing CRITICAL threats THEN the dashboard SHALL maintain visual stability
4. WHEN CRITICAL events are active THEN the user SHALL be able to read all information without visual disruption
5. WHEN multiple CRITICAL events occur THEN the dashboard SHALL handle them gracefully without performance degradation

### Requirement 4: Improve Threat Counter Accuracy

**User Story:** As a user monitoring system activity, I want accurate threat counters that reflect all detected threats, so that I can understand the current security status at a glance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN threats are detected THEN the threat counter SHALL accurately count all Suspicious, Malicious, and Critical events
2. WHEN the event counter increases THEN the threat counter SHALL update correspondingly for non-benign events
3. WHEN viewing historical events THEN the threat counter SHALL reflect the total count of all threat-level events
4. WHEN the system processes events THEN the counter SHALL distinguish between total events and actual threats
5. WHEN threat levels change THEN the counter SHALL update in real-time to reflect current threat status

### Requirement 5: Implement Professional Exit Experience

**User Story:** As a user finishing a monitoring session, I want a professional exit experience with options to save session data, so that I can preserve important findings and maintain a clean terminal state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user presses 'q' to quit THEN the system SHALL display a rich dialog with save options
2. WHEN the user presses Ctrl+C THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle the interrupt with the same dialog
3. WHEN the exit dialog appears THEN the user SHALL have options to save event history, logs, and reports
4. WHEN the user chooses to save data THEN the system SHALL export the session data to a specified file
5. WHEN the user chooses not to save THEN the system SHALL discard temporary data and exit cleanly
6. WHEN exiting THEN the terminal SHALL be left in a clean state without residual display artifacts

### Requirement 6: Enhance Startup Experience with ASCII Art

**User Story:** As a user starting the monitoring system, I want to see the professional ASCII art logo and system information before the dashboard starts, so that I have a clear understanding of what's being launched.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN the ASCII art logo SHALL be displayed prominently
2. WHEN the logo is shown THEN system information and selected options SHALL be displayed clearly
3. WHEN startup information is presented THEN there SHALL be a brief delay to allow reading
4. WHEN the delay completes THEN the dashboard SHALL start smoothly without overlapping the startup display
5. WHEN different command-line options are used THEN the startup display SHALL reflect the chosen configuration
6. WHEN the dashboard starts THEN the transition from startup screen SHALL be clean and professional

### Requirement 7: Improve Overall Demo Stability

**User Story:** As a presenter demonstrating the system, I want consistent, stable performance during presentations, so that I can focus on explaining the security concepts rather than troubleshooting display issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN demonstrating the system THEN all features SHALL work reliably without unexpected errors
2. WHEN switching between different views THEN the transitions SHALL be smooth and predictable
3. WHEN processing events THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent performance regardless of threat level
4. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN all controls SHALL respond appropriately without causing display issues
5. WHEN running extended demonstrations THEN the system SHALL maintain stability and performance over time
