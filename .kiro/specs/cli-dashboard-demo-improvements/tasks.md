# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Fix synthetic signal generation enum issue

  - Add missing SIGNAL_CLONING_ATTACK to ScenarioType enum in utils/signal_constants.py
  - Verify all attack types are properly mapped and accessible
  - Test --synthetic flag works without AttributeError
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4_

- [x] 2. Fix display duplication on larger screens

  - Investigate Rich layout behavior differences between small and large screens
  - Implement consistent panel sizing logic regardless of terminal dimensions
  - Fix text wrapping and content duplication in Signal Analysis and Technical Evidence panels
  - Test rendering consistency across multiple screen sizes (small, medium, large)
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [ ] 3. Fix critical alert refresh bug (highest priority)

  - Identify root cause of constant refreshing during CRITICAL threat events
  - Implement refresh rate limiting or differential rendering for CRITICAL events
  - Add state management to prevent unnecessary re-renders during critical alerts
  - Ensure dashboard remains stable and readable when viewing historical CRITICAL events
  - Test extended periods with multiple CRITICAL events for stability
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5_

- [ ] 4. Implement accurate threat counter

  - Fix threat counter logic to properly count all Suspicious, Malicious, and Critical events
  - Separate total event count from actual threat count
  - Ensure counter updates in real-time as events are processed
  - Add proper threat level validation and categorization
  - Test counter accuracy with mixed event types and threat levels
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5_

- [ ] 5. Implement professional exit experience

  - Create Rich dialog system for exit confirmation when user presses 'q' or Ctrl+C
  - Add options in dialog for saving event history, logs, and reports to file
  - Implement session data export functionality with proper file handling
  - Ensure clean terminal state restoration on exit
  - Handle both graceful quit ('q') and interrupt (Ctrl+C) scenarios
  - Test exit experience preserves important session data when requested
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6_

- [ ] 6. Enhance startup experience with ASCII art timing

  - Display ASCII art logo immediately on application startup
  - Show system information and selected command-line options clearly
  - Add configurable delay (2-3 seconds) before starting the main dashboard
  - Implement smooth transition from startup screen to dashboard
  - Ensure startup display reflects chosen configuration (mock, synthetic, TCP, etc.)
  - Test startup sequence provides professional presentation experience
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6_

- [ ] 7. Add comprehensive testing for demo stability

  - Create unit tests for all fixed components (synthetic generation, rendering, counters)
  - Add integration tests for complete startup and exit sequences
  - Implement performance tests for critical event handling and large event lists
  - Test extended demo runs for stability and consistent performance
  - Verify all keyboard navigation works correctly without display issues
  - _Requirements: 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5_

- [ ] 8. Performance optimization and monitoring
  - Add performance monitoring for rendering operations during critical events
  - Implement memory management for extended demo sessions
  - Optimize rendering performance for large event lists
  - Add refresh rate limiting to prevent excessive updates
  - Test system maintains responsiveness during high-activity periods
  - _Requirements: 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5_
