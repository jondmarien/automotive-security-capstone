# RTL-SDR to NFC Integration Requirements

## Introduction

This feature integrates real RTL-SDR signal processing with Raspberry Pi Pico W NFC detection to demonstrate a complete automotive security monitoring system. The system must process actual RF signals from the RTL-SDR V4 dongle, analyze them for automotive threats, and trigger NFC detection on the Pico W for comprehensive security monitoring.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Real Key Fob Signal Detection and Analysis

**User Story:** As a capstone student, I want the system to detect and analyze actual key fob transmissions, so that I can prove my detection algorithms work on real automotive signals.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a real key fob button is pressed near the RTL-SDR THEN the system SHALL capture the RF transmission within 100ms
2. WHEN key fob IQ samples are processed THEN the system SHALL extract signal features (power, frequency, burst pattern, timing)
3. WHEN signal features are analyzed THEN the system SHALL identify key fob-specific characteristics (rolling codes, FSK modulation, timing patterns)
4. WHEN legitimate key fob signals are detected THEN the system SHALL classify them as "key_fob_transmission" with threat level BENIGN
5. WHEN the same key fob signal is replayed from a recording THEN the system SHALL detect it as "Replay Attack" with threat level MALICIOUS

### Requirement 2: Automotive Attack Pattern Recognition

**User Story:** As a security researcher, I want to demonstrate detection of real automotive attack patterns, so that I can prove the system identifies actual security threats.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a key fob signal is recorded and replayed THEN the system SHALL detect timing anomalies and classify as replay attack
2. WHEN multiple rapid key fob attempts occur THEN the system SHALL detect brute force patterns and escalate threat level
3. WHEN RF noise is introduced during key fob transmission THEN the system SHALL detect jamming interference patterns
4. WHEN legitimate vs. malicious signals are compared THEN the system SHALL demonstrate >90% classification accuracy
5. WHEN attack patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL provide technical evidence (signal characteristics, timing analysis, power measurements)

### Requirement 3: Pico W NFC Detection Integration

**User Story:** As a capstone student, I want the Pico W to perform NFC detection when RF threats are detected, so that I can demonstrate multi-modal security monitoring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Pico W receives a high-threat signal detection THEN it SHALL activate NFC scanning mode
2. WHEN NFC scanning is active THEN the system SHALL monitor for NFC tags within 10cm range
3. WHEN an NFC tag is detected THEN the system SHALL capture UID and send to main system
4. WHEN NFC detection correlates with RF threats THEN the system SHALL generate combined security alerts
5. WHEN no NFC activity is detected within 30 seconds THEN the system SHALL return to normal monitoring mode

### Requirement 4: Real-Time Event Streaming

**User Story:** As a demonstration audience, I want to see real-time events in the CLI dashboard, so that I can understand the system's detection capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN signal processing detects events THEN they SHALL be streamed to CLI dashboard within 200ms
2. WHEN events are displayed THEN they SHALL show timestamp, event type, threat level, and technical details
3. WHEN multiple events occur simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent processing without data loss
4. WHEN the system processes 100+ events per minute THEN performance SHALL remain stable
5. WHEN demonstration mode is active THEN the system SHALL provide compelling realistic scenarios

### Requirement 5: Hardware Integration and Reliability

**User Story:** As a capstone student, I want reliable hardware integration, so that my demonstration works consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN RTL-SDR hardware is connected THEN the system SHALL detect and configure it automatically
2. WHEN Pico W connects to WiFi THEN it SHALL establish TCP connection to main system within 10 seconds
3. WHEN hardware disconnection occurs THEN the system SHALL detect it and attempt reconnection
4. WHEN hardware is unavailable THEN the system SHALL fallback to mock mode seamlessly
5. WHEN system runs for 30+ minutes THEN it SHALL maintain stable operation without memory leaks

### Requirement 6: Live Demonstration of Detection Capabilities

**User Story:** As a capstone student presenting to professors, I want to demonstrate real-time detection of actual automotive attacks, so that I can prove my algorithms work on real signals.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a real key fob is used THEN the system SHALL show "BENIGN - Key Fob Transmission" with signal analysis details
2. WHEN the same key fob signal is replayed from a recording THEN the system SHALL immediately detect "MALICIOUS - Replay Attack"
3. WHEN rapid key fob button presses occur THEN the system SHALL detect "MALICIOUS - Brute Force Attack"
4. WHEN RF jamming is introduced THEN the system SHALL detect "MALICIOUS - Jamming Attack" with interference analysis
5. WHEN each detection occurs THEN the CLI SHALL display technical proof (power levels, timing analysis, signal characteristics)
6. WHEN NFC tags are scanned during RF events THEN the system SHALL correlate multi-modal attack indicators
