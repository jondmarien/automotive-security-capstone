# RTL-SDR NFC Integration - Task 3.1 Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the successful implementation of Task 3.1: NFC Correlation Activation System for the Automotive Security Capstone project. The implementation enables the Raspberry Pi Pico W client to activate NFC scanning on high-threat RF events, manage correlation state and timeouts, provide LED indicators for NFC correlation mode, and implement correlation event data structures.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. NFC Correlation Activation
- Modified `process_signal_detection` method to activate NFC correlation when high-threat RF events (threat_level > 0.7) are detected
- Added `activate_nfc_correlation` method to handle correlation activation
- Implemented visual LED indication for active correlation mode

### 2. Correlation State Management
- Added `nfc_correlation_mode` flag to track correlation state
- Added `active_rf_threat` to store the triggering RF threat event
- Implemented `nfc_correlation_timeout` method to automatically deactivate correlation after 30 seconds

### 3. LED Indicators
- NFC LED (GPIO 27) indicates active correlation mode
- Alert LED (GPIO 28) provides visual feedback for correlated detections
- Standard LED patterns for different states

### 4. Correlation Event Data Structures
- Implemented `correlated_security_event` message type for communication with backend
- Enhanced `handle_nfc_detection` to generate correlated events when NFC is detected during correlation mode
- Added correlation activation and timeout event types

## Code Changes

### Backend/Pico/main.py
- Added NFC correlation state variables in `__init__`
- Modified `process_signal_detection` to activate correlation on high-threat events
- Added `activate_nfc_correlation` method
- Added `nfc_correlation_timeout` method
- Enhanced `handle_nfc_detection` to generate correlated events
- Added proper LED indication for all states

### Tests
- Created comprehensive test suite in `tests/test_pico_nfc_correlation.py`
- Tests cover all major functionality including:
  - NFC correlation activation
  - Correlation timeout
  - Correlated NFC detection
  - Regular NFC detection
  - Signal detection processing
- All tests passing

## Test Results
All tests are passing, verifying that:
1. NFC correlation is properly activated on high-threat RF events
2. Correlation mode times out correctly after 30 seconds
3. NFC detections during correlation mode generate correlated security events
4. NFC detections outside correlation mode generate regular events
5. Signal detection processing correctly activates correlation for high-threat events

## Integration with Existing System
The implementation integrates seamlessly with the existing Automotive Security Pico architecture:
- Uses existing WiFi and server communication infrastructure
- Leverages existing LED system for visual feedback
- Extends existing NFC monitoring without disrupting regular operation
- Maintains compatibility with existing backend event server

## Future Considerations
- Integration with backend event server to handle and display correlated security events
- Additional correlation algorithms for different threat types
- Configuration options for correlation timeout duration
- Enhanced logging for correlation events
