### Usage Examples
```python
# Enhanced signal processing
from rtl_sdr.enhanced_signal_bridge import EnhancedSignalProcessingBridge
bridge = EnhancedSignalProcessingBridge(rtl_server_manager)
await bridge.start_signal_processing()

# Threat detection
from rtl_sdr.brute_force_detector import BruteForceDetector
detector = BruteForceDetector(signal_history)
result = detector.check_brute_force(detected_signal)
```

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Run specific test suites
python -m pytest tests/test_automotive_signal_analyzer.py -v
python -m pytest tests/test_brute_force_detector.py -v
python -m pytest tests/test_jamming_detector.py -v

# Run with coverage
python -m pytest tests/ --cov=rtl_sdr --cov=detection --cov-report=html
```

### Breaking Changes
- None - all changes are backward compatible
- Legacy signal processing still supported
- Enhanced mode is optional

### Migration Guide
- Existing scripts continue to work unchanged
- Enhanced features available via new API
- No configuration changes required
- Gradual migration path available
