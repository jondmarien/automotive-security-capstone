### **Manual Testing**
```python
from utils.simple_performance_monitor import get_performance_monitor
monitor = get_performance_monitor()
monitor.record_signal_processed(45.0)
monitor.record_event_generated('replay_attack')
print(monitor.get_dashboard_summary())
# Output: "Latency: 45.0ms | Events: 1 | Threats: 1"
```
