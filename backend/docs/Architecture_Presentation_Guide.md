### **The Journey of Data Through Your System**

1. **Signal Capture**: "The RTL-SDR captures raw RF signals from the automotive environment"

2. **Data Streaming**: "Raw IQ data flows over USB to my RTL-TCP server, which makes it available on the network"

3. **Signal Processing**: "My signal processing engine connects to the TCP stream and analyzes the IQ samples for known automotive protocols"

4. **Threat Detection**: "The processed signals go through my custom detection algorithms that classify events and assign threat levels"

5. **Event Distribution**: "Security events are immediately distributed through my TCP event server to all connected clients"

6. **Real-time Response**: "The dashboard shows live events while the Pico W triggers physical alerts - LEDs, NFC, or other notifications"

### **Key Technical Decisions**
